Imagine you’re at a bar with some friends from college and they ask you what exactly this team you manage does. You probably have a quick spiel you recite in situations like this, listing off the parts of the product you own, what other teams you work with, maybe some examples of projects your team has shipped recently. You’ve recited this same blurb hundreds of times to friends and family, coworkers, and candidates. But this is your team’s equivalent of a VC pitch — it’s a chance to communicate why your team matters and what’s exciting about your work, and it’s all others have to go on when they form a picture of what your team is in their mind. You don’t want to waste this chance explaining where exactly you sit in the org chart. It’s worth thinking about how you brand your team to others and the impact it can have for you and your engineers.

# Why does team branding matter?

The work my team does is not the sexiest in the world. We don’t work on the high revenue generating products, or with the flashy new tech, and most of what we do either flies under the radar (no one notices until it breaks) or are internal tools making other teams’ work more efficient. If you were really being uncharitable you might say we’re the dumping ground for everything that doesn’t fit into the other product teams.

If I described my team that way every time I talked about it I’d never convince another new hire to join my team, no one else at the company would be excited to work with us, I’d have a hard time justifying what we do to upper management, and my engineers would slowly descend into madness as they question why they even bother sticking around. Good thing I don’t describe it that way!

Your team’s branding is the first contact anyone has with what your team does, but it also frames how they think about your team going forward, and it contextualizes everything your team actually does in the future. Is your team critical for the success of the business? Do your projects have a significant impact? Are you working on interesting problems or is your team kind of boring? Is it cool to be on your team?

# What is branding?

As a team lead or manager, it’s your job to be the point of contact for your team. You should be shielding them from unnecessary communication, filtering down to just what’s relevant to them and protecting them from outside distractions. But that means you’re also the face of your team, and it’s your responsibility to represent them well to others.

Branding encompasses a lot of things in this context, but primarily it’s how you talk about what your team does. What do others think is your place in the org? If the company as to deal with a new problem, how will leadership know whether or not it’s your team’s responsibility? What is the identity of your team — what does it mean to be on your team instead of any of the other engineering teams?

You have influence over all of this by the way you talk about your team, and it’s your job to figure it out.

# Who is your audience?

“Everyone” might be a bit too broad, but I think there are couple of important groups to think about when designing your team branding:

- candidates
- external stakeholders at your company
- leadership
- the engineers on your team

## Candidates

How candidates are matched up with teams varies from company to company, but at some point you have sell the candidate on joining your team. Even if candidates are assigned to teams directly with no say in the matter, you are going to want buy in from your new engineer so they’re not constantly looking for the next best thing. At most companies I think candidates *do* have a say in the matter, in which case you’ll often be selling your team to them.

If I described my team the way I did above (the dumping ground of the company) I’d never get anyone excited to join. If someone found out they were going to be joining your team, would they be disappointed? Or are you the team candidates are proactively asking about?

With candidates I think it’s important to focus on what you can offer them (you are selling them after all). 


###### notes

- is branding just about what you can offer others?
- focus on the cool parts of your job, the impact, the “why”
- what makes you excited about your team?
- nothing wrong with a cool name

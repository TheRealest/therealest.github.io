Onboarding is a critical time for new hires



###### notes

- the primary purpose of the onboarding process is to take a brand new engineer and turn them into a productive member of your team
- a lot of the time is spent getting their dev environment set up, meeting everybody at the company, and learning the codebase
- at some point they have to start shipping code, and usually I start with some simple bugs to separate learning the deployment process, the language/framework, and the codebase from solving actual problems
- ramp up to bigger tasks, but quickly get to a starter project
- the important piece is that a starter project should be something the new engineer can be known for

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>orking and cloning a github repo to modify or play around with the code is an extremely common practice, but it's not exactly painless. Having to switch between the browser and the command line to fork and clone is often only a minor annoyance, but setting up your remotes can cause headaches, especially if you cloned the original repo rather than your own fork.</p>

- project planning/gantt charts
	- review process (draft + review from down/out/up):
		1. Draft it yourself
		2. Get feedback from your team
		3. Get feedback from external stakeholders
		4. Get feedback from upper management
- how to figure out how many people you’re gonna need going forward when your roadmap is only a couple months long
	- ???
- how to estimate how long a project will take another engineer on your team
	- Just estimate for yourself and multiply by some factor? Or add some factor? Maybe do research on this
- Project management skills more junior engineers coming from big tech companies to startups don’t have that you should work on with them:
	- Writing specs
		- Who is the audience? What is the point of this?
		- What level of detail to get into in the spec — from description of project/problem to implementation details
		- How much research to do on the parts of the codebase you’ll be working on — what can you figure out later while you’re building it, and what needs to be figured out now
		- When to get feedback, and from who? How many reviewers? Do you have to address every comment?
		- Who do you need to ask permission? Who do you have to check with before building the thing?
	- Scope management
		- Finding the MVP
		- Figuring out what “nice to have” means
		- Setting boundaries about what goes in this project vs some other future project — being ok with saying “no”
		- Figuring out when it’s worth writing new code vs reusing/refactoring existing code
	- User/external stakeholder research
		- Not guessing at what features are useful or will get use
	- Thinking ahead about external impact
		- Will this generate support inbound?
		- Will this create work for other engineers or will it reduce their work?
		- How hard will this be to work on or maintain in the future?
		- Does this need to be documented, technically or from a process perspective?
		- Will legal care about this?
	- Translating the spec into tickets
		- Again who is the audience? What is the point?
		- How to split the work into tickets
			- If you need help, could you give another engineer one ticket and have them be able to complete it?
		- How to size and estimate the tickets
	- Estimating the length of the entire project
	- Having specified “primary” code reviewers for the project
	- Notifying external stakeholders/explaining it to other engineers once it’s done
	- Post mortems/looking back and giving yourself feedback
- How to do recaps
